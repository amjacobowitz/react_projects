# react_projects
Games and Projects to Demonstrate Fluency in React.js

This is a collection of scripts to produce react scripts with increasing complexity and difficulty.  The scripts start with simple forms and work their way to logic games.  The scripts of most note are the tic-tac-toe game and the war card game.  They demonstrate my ability to "think in react" by rendering several components with appropriate state while also maintaining the logic of the games.
