Games and Projects to Demonstrate Fluency in React.js

This is a collection of react scripts that showcase my proficiency with React.js. The scripts of most note are the ***tic-tac-toe game*** and the ***war card game***.  They demonstrate my ability to "think in react" by rendering several components with appropriate state while also maintaining the logic of the games.
