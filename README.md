# react_projects
Games and Projects to Demonstrate Fluency in React.js

This is a collection of react scripts that feature increasing complexity and difficulty.  The scripts start with simple forms and work their way to logic games.  

The scripts of most note are the <bold>tic-tac-toe game<bold> and the war card game.  They demonstrate my ability to "think in react" by rendering several components with appropriate state while also maintaining the logic of the games.
